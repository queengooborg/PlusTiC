## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### What happened to the original PlusTiC mod?

PlusTiC was originally developed by Landmaster, a developer with a rich history in developing game mods.  Landmaster, along with a number of various contributors on GitHub, had built the majority of the mod into what it is today.

However, the mods that Landmaster developed have all been removed from CurseForge, due to an [introduction of malicious code that would prevent a specific player from being able to log onto any servers](https://github.com/TeamDman/PlusTiC/commit/9147573c6d514ff88825a8cc1ab8438f9c80a14c).  While they had [removed the code and released a new version just a few days later](https://github.com/TeamDman/PlusTiC/commit/d0b4d17ce542a186a1660c7fac6083aa3eea37aa#diff-a516bfe6aaa4dd4f38abbd0de3bdd0dbL197-L204), the damage was already done.  Since then, their mods have completely vanished from the internet, including the GitHub repositories.

PlusTiC was eventually forked by TeamDman in 2020, released as "xXx_MoreToolMats_xXx (a PlusTiC fork without the evil)", and maintained by them for almost exactly three years.  Development on the original mod had unfortunately come to a complete halt.

There was one feature in particular that I was looking forward to seeing at some point: an update for modern versions of Minecraft. Since it was never updated for versions beyond 1.12.2, it was one of the mods that kept me from upgrading my own modpack for playing with friends.  As such, I wanted to try my hand at updating the mod for newer versions of Minecraft, so I forked it and started developing PlusTiC Reforged.

### Why is this version called "Reforged"?

Contrary to what many may think, the name "Reforged" wasn't inspired by the NeoForge (or original Forge) modloader.  I felt that it was important to distinguish this version as a separate mod from the original, and as Tinkers' Construct is all about tool forging, I felt that it was fitting to utilize that as a part of the name!

### Will you port this mod to Fabric or Quilt?

Tinkers' Construct itself doesn't support Fabric/Quilt, so...definitely not.

If Tinker's Construct _did_ introduce support for Fabric/Quilt, however, I probably still wouldn't implement support.  It's not because I dislike those modloaders, but rather that this is 100% a hobby project, and I just don't have the time to learn a completely new modloader.

### For versions of Minecraft that NeoForge is available, will you port it to the original Forge too?

I don't particlarly plan to support the original Forge from Minecraft 1.20.2 and up, which are the versions that NeoForge is available for.  While it should "just work" as they share similar codebases (at least at first), my time to work on this is limited.

### Are you going to add code that blocks a specific player's UUID from joining servers?

Of course not, that would be silly and stupid!
